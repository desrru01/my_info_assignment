The only extra curricular things I have is my job
I don't have the time to be joining clubs
Nor can I afford to be going everywhere

To be honest, there are some activities I would like to attend on campus
However, I think they will take up too much of my precious time. 
But I think this campus can be quite active, especially during summer time.
